Hi there!

My name is Dylan and this is the associated repository to my personal website.

In my website, you'll be able to learn about who I am, the work that I have done,
and how to contact me. Over time, I will update my website to reflect new projects 
and news relating to me, so don't be afraid to check it out periodically!

This repository will contain some of the files for my projects, but make sure to check 
the website to find out where you can access any of the files you may be looking for.

This website was created using the Halcyonic theme from html5up.net
If you are interested in creating your own website and are looking for a theme to build 
off of, check them out!

Thanks for stopping by!
Dylan Lam
